Head mounted displays (HMDs) are ideal devices for displaying immersive stereoscopic content, but they often cause significant visual discomfort, including eye fatigue, headaches, and nausea. A conflict between accommodation and vergence demands on stereoscopic displays is known to significantly contribute to this discomfort. We report the result of psychophysical experiments on the effectiveness of using dynamic depth of field (DoF) blur to reduce visual discomfort when using stereoscopic HMDs. Our DoF implementation adjusts the focal region in stereoscopic content based on the estimated view vector in real-time. Our implementation is realized in a commercial game engine. Participants reported a decrease of visual discomfort using a simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) when dynamic DoF blur is enabled. On average, we observe a reduction of the total sickness measure by approximately 30\% when dynamic DoF blurring is enabled on HMDs.
