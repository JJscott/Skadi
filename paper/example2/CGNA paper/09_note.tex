Stuff in here won't render, but is included so i can easily add them in as required.

\cite{Toyoura:2012:MPD:2407516.2407526} created a HMD in which the DOF was controllable by the user to convey depth. Using a spatial dextirity task as a metric, they show inconsistant improvements in task completion time for some participants but report no overall improvement.\\


the first occurrence of Simulator Sickness was reported on the first helicopter fight simulator, back in 1956 \cite{miller}\\

	Simulator sickness is referred to as the incidence of sickness symptoms associated with motion sickness, arising in the specific case where the user is interfacing with a visual display\cite{johnson}. \\


	

	It has been proposed that the disassociation of the vergence and accommodation depth cues in the human visual system when stereoscopic displays are utilized is a significant factor contributing to simulator sickness \cite{howard:depthPerception}. \\  

	
Viirre and Bush (2002) pointed out indirect effects of VE on the 
visual system (i.e., eyestrain, changes in binocular vision, and 
visual acuity), balance, motion detection, nausea, and motion 
sickness.


	
	
 Banks, Akeley, Hoffman, and Girshick (2008) found performance at an orientation detection task improved when blur was appropriate for the convergence
